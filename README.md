# TextTasks

Yet another task management bundle for TextMate. This one is heavily inspired by [Tasks.tmbundle][1] by Henrik Nyh.

## Why don't I just use Tasks? 

In my perpetual search for the perfect editor, the turn has come to TextMate and I wanted to dive under the skin to become fluent with TextMate. What better way to get into the details than writing a bundle of my own. This is my ongoing learning experience.
