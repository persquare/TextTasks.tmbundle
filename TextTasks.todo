Actions:
  + List MIT's command doesn't work if other tags present after @mit tag (use regex from remind)
  - Archived items should be stripped of tags

Bugs:
  - Move Selection to Project destroys target todo file
  - Links should get scoped.
  - Helper files and some commands doesn't handle encodings correctly
    Which ones?

Enhancements:
  - Settings
    - User selectable first entry in projects pop-up list
    - Archive with/without date
    - Date format
    - Section names
    - Default window size
  - Documentation
    - Prettify documentation
    - Document syntax
      TaskPaper file format [definition][1]
  - TextTasks list heading with MITs, e.g. work:ITM : Prepare
  - Produce a nice output when no MITs or flagged mails exists (fortune cookie)
  - Improve 'New item' command, it is too crude.
    FIXME: Too crude in what sense?
  - Improve Move Tagged by including subtasks
  - Implement New Project With Selection command
    * See 'Move Selection to Project' command
    * Perhaps just a 'New projectâ€¦' item in the pop-up list of 'Move selection'?

  References:
    - Accept dropped references
      What does one get when different stuff is dropped onto TM?
        * URL - insert URL
        * BibDesk refs - insert text (use BibDesk Alt-drag set to Insert URL)
        * File - captured by Drag Command Action (use * wildcard for filetype)
    - Dropping files should add a reference
      Needs dedicated (named in settings) section?
    - Make indexed reference from URL
    - Jump back and forth between a reference and its definition

Interaction with other apps:
  - Scan Reminders and create a (transient?) document of all accounts/lists
    Perhaps have some way to clear or transfer Reminders tasks to TextTasks
  - Refine interaction with Reminders
    - Make due date in Reminders into alerts instead?
    - Handle due/date/remind tags differently?


Notes:
  Using a symlink from ~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles/TextTasks.tmbundle to actual source

  zk://150314135039
---- 2014-10-11 11:29:37 ----
+ Drop the inbox CLI/applescript
  It is probably better as an external tool.
+ Decide on how to handle settings. Is the current approach good?
x Rename .texttask_config to .texttask_config.py
---- 2014-09-04 09:16:06 ----
x invalid syntax highlight
  trailing ':' on anything but heading is invalid
+ Fix tab-settings etc
  This is in the settings file. Now use it.
---- 2014-09-03 22:15:24 ----
+ Make "Soft wrap" the default
  Use settings (it is possible to set environment from settings)
+ Make tag tab-triggered on @ instead of a command
+ Make tag-list in 'Insert Tag' a configuration
+ Add tasks tagged with date/due/remind to reminders automatically on save
  nvRemind is not what I need; write a script to do it.
---- 2014-09-03 21:41:57 ----
+ Arrange bundle menu in a sensible way
---- 2014-08-20 10:30:16 ----
+ Collect @next, @mit, etc. tags to a 'transient' list for quick navigation @mit

+ Archive
+ Add date entry when archiving?
  Requires dedicated (named in settings) section
x Make archiving/deletion of cancelled tasks a setting
+ Handle [references][1] and [1]: http://dn.se etc
+ Rename 'New item*' to 'New task*'
+ Check out nvRemind (Not working for me)
+ Menu bar (quicknote)
+ Verify that inbox adds tasks at new line
+ Open URL command handles refs too
+ Add link support
+ Provide documentation
+ Autogenerated keyboard shortcuts
+ Using a doc-comment in the body of the script could provide additional (optional) info.
+ Merge in Markdown formatted help-file
+ Allow multiple directories in PROJPATH
x wrap the common preamble into module
  make it local so a simple `import ttsupport` will setup all paths etc.
  Apperently impossible.
+ Include or delete cancelled tasks
+ Promote selection to tag
  Also promote current word.
+ Move selection to project
+ Cancel
+ Similar to "Toggle Done"
+ Itemize
  Promote line to item anywhere in line, unless already -|+|x
  Perhaps cycle: pending -> done -> cancelled -> comment ->
+ Include immediate comments on archiving
x Indent/outdent with tab/shift-tab anywhere
  Including multiple line selection
+ Auto-itemize on enter
  Only if line is item
+ Enter splits current line at cursor
+ CMD-Enter creates a new line
x Name project in file 1st line @decide
+ Moving the cursor from a command: use insert as snippet for output, see:
