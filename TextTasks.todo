Special sections:
  - References
    - Dropping files should add a reference
      Needs dedicated (named in settings) section?
    - Make indexed reference from URL
    - Jump back and forth between a reference and its definition
  - Issue tracker
    Allow local references like #1 to refer to bugs listed like references
    #1: bug desciption

Settings:
  - Archive with/without date
  - Date format
  - Section names
  - Default window size

Enhancements:
  - Archived items should be stripped of tags
  - Add some smarts to 'New item' command, it is too crude.
  - Make 'inbox' show up as the first entry in projects pop-up list
  - Documentation
    - Some basic documentation
    - Prettify documentation
    - Document syntax
      TaskPaper file format [definition][1]
  - Accept dropped file/URL/mail references
    What does one get when different stuff is dropped onto TM?
      * URL - insert URL
      * BibDesk refs - insert text (use BibDesk Alt-drag set to Insert URL)
      * File - captured by Drag Command Action (use * wildcard for filetype)
      * e-mails - Not possible?
      * reminders
      *
  - Improve Move Tagged by including subtasks
  - Implement New Project With Selection command
    * See 'Move Selection to Project' command
    * Perhaps just a 'New project…' item in the pop-up list of 'Move selection'?
  - Rename .texttask_config to .texttask_config.py
  - Add project template with tab trigger

Interaction with other apps:
  - Send tasks to Reminders, iCal, etc.
  - Scan Reminders and create a (transient?) document of all accounts/lists
    Perhaps have some way to clear or transfer Reminders tasks to TextTasks
  - Refine interaction with Reminders
    - Make due date in Reminders into alerts instead?
    - Handle due/date/remind tags differently?
  - Add to inbox from anywhere
    Examples of anywhere
    - Mail
    - Service
  - Document inbox command

Installer script:
  - Add callback script to settings file
    This is run when the settings file (Settings… from the TextTasks Bundle menu) is saved.
    It will add/remove the following (based on settings file)
    - path to inbox CLI to system PATH
    - alias for inbox.app to dock
    - mail rules

Coding issues:
  - Must specify file type for dropped files

Bugs:
  - List MIT's command doesn't work if other tags present after @mit tag (use regex from remind) @mit
  - links should get scoped.
  - Toggle Status command doesn't treat comment correctly
  - Helper files and some commands doesn't handle encodings correctly

Unstructured tasks:
  - Proper language bundle for taskpaper syntax
    Proper means: folding of comments, recursive folding of tasks
  - create helper files (lexer & parser)
  	See https://github.com/bevesce/TodoFlow/blob/master/src/parser.py for some starting help


Notes:
  Using a symlink from ~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles/TextTasks.tmbundle to actual source
